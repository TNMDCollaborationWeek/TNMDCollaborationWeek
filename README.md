# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Collaboration Week mini-hackathon  

# General rules  
+ You will need to create your own public GitHub account with your non-work email. Your GitHub username can be `firstnamelastname` as long as you **do not** reference any internal work or work organisation information on your GitHub account. You are also welcome to use code names like `lazywombat` for your Github account.  
+ Click [here]() for instruction on how to create a GitHub account and to download and access the Git GUI.       
+ Your team lead will create a public repository, which will host your team entry for the mini-hackathon. The team challenge **should not** reference any internal work or work organisation information, as this is a public repository.   
+ We recommend first creating your own branch, working in your own local branch and commiting your code changes to your own remote branch, before merging changes to your main branch i.e. create and commit code back to a `lazywombat_dev` branch first.
