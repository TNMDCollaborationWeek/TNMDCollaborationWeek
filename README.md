# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Collaboration Week mini-hackathon  

# General rules  
+ Work **outside** your work environment (you can work from your work laptop outside your work virtual machine).  
+ You will need to create your own public GitHub account with your **non-work email**. Your GitHub username can be `firstnamelastname` as long as you **do not** reference any internal work or work organisation information on your GitHub account. You are also welcome to use code names like `lazywombat` for your Github account.  
+ Click [here](https://github.com/TNMDCollaborationWeek/GettingStarted/tree/main#step-1-create-a-personal-github-account-everyone) for instructions on how to create a GitHub account and to download and access the Git GUI.       
+ Your team lead will create a public repository, which will host your team entry for the mini-hackathon. The team challenge **should not** reference any internal work or work organisation information, as this is a public repository.   
+ We recommend creating your own local `username_dev` branch, working on code in your local branch and then pushing your commited code changes to your remote `username_dev` branch. This allows a second person (peer reviewer or team lead) to merge your code changes to your main remote branch using a pull request.  
+ Click [here](https://github.com/TNMDCollaborationWeek/GettingStarted/tree/main#step-4-using-git-to-publish-code-to-github-everyone) for instructions on how to use a simple Git branching strategy to implement project version control.      

> Enjoy yourself, embrace the hackathon chaos and experience the power of technical project management with code version control.
